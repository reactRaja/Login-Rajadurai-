        The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is
        a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known
        as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The
        fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red
        color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities,
        either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream,
        milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas
        are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss,
        perfume, and many others.<br />

        The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s
        via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and
        Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François
        Frézier in 1714.[2] Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in
        commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which
        was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.

        The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry.
        Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy
        part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle
        that holds the ovaries.[4] Each apparent "seed" (achene) on the outside
        of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed
        inside it.[4] In 2019, world production of strawberries was 9 million
        tonnes, led by China with 40% of the total.
